    content: `Domestic orders can take up to 5-6 business days, (or longer depending on the circumstances).
    International orders can take up to 5-15 business days, (or longer depending on the circumstances).
    If you’d rather come and collect your order please get in touch to arrange this, shipping costs can be refunded accordingly if this is organised.
    
    I will always aim to have things sent out as quickly as possible but occasionally, due to events/timings/number of orders, it may take a few days before parcels are shipped out. Please me patient, this business is mostly run solely by me, save from some occasional help, I’m not a large business with a team of people, every order is packaged, labeled and sent off myself. If for any reason there are delays in sending work out from the studio I’ll be in touch.
    
    When an item is sent from my studio to be shipped abroad, it is in the jurisdiction of the receiving country’s postage service and customs. If for whatever reason something goes missing, please get in touch with myself and the postage companies. I’ll always try my best to help the situation but occasionally things can go astray, in which case please get in touch and we can arrange a refund or for another order to be sent out. This happens very rarely and I deal with any instances of breakage/missing items on a case by case basis.
    
    There might be tax or customs charges on some items shipped abroad. Please keep in mind that you may need to pay customs fees upon pick up of your parcel.`,

    name: "Returns and Refunds",
    content: `Returns are only accepted if I accidentally ship out the wrong items, (I’m only human, mistakes can happen), if this does occur, please get in touch and I’ll rectify the order. If the pots have been used I cannot refund them or exchange due to their crackled nature.

    If your parcel hasn’t arrived a week after dispatch please get in touch with me immediately so I can attempt to fix or find the parcel as after 10 days there’s an extraordinarily low chance I’ll be able to find it or correct the situation. I usually ship about 200-250 parcels and cannot track each one individually and check, and double check, that it has arrived correctly. I do not offer full refunds, (partial refund is dependant on situation), if you get in touch more than a month after the original dispatch date as because it’s so late there’s virtually nothing I can do as the couriers normally don’t refund shipping or insurance a month or more after dispatch.`,
